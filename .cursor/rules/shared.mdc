# AI Rules for wireguard-config-manager

This project is a web-based WireGuard configuration manager. It enables users and administrators to efficiently import, assign, and manage WireGuard peer configurations, with strong support for role-based access and detailed audit logging. The application is built using Astro 5 for static and server-rendered pages, React 19 for dynamic UI components, and Tailwind CSS 4 for styling. Supabase is used for authentication, database, and backend logic, providing secure management of users, peers, and event logs. Key features include domain-restricted registration, admin-controlled peer assignment, automatic and manual peer claiming, configuration download, revocation, and comprehensive audit trails. The codebase follows a strict, maintainable structure to support scalability and clean development practices.

## Coding practices

### Guidelines for clean code

- Use feedback from linters to improve the code when making changes.
- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
- Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
- Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
