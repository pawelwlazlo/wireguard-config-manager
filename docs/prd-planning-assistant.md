You are an experienced product manager whose task is to help create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the provided information. Your goal is to generate a list of questions and recommendations that will be used in subsequent prompting to create a complete PRD.

Please carefully review the following information:

<project_description>
### Main Problem

Manual distribution of WireGuard configurations to users in the company. Additionally, the need to keep records of issued configurations.

### Minimum Feature Set

- The application should read WireGuard configurations from a specified directory
- Users should be able to download WireGuard configurations
- Users should be able to register and log in to the system
- First registered user becomes an administrator
- Administrator should be able to set the maximum number of peers for a given user
- Administrator should be able to display the list of peers and users assigned to users
- Administrator should be able to display the list of users

### What is NOT included in MVP scope

- Automatic generation of WireGuard configurations for new users, the system only distributes previously created configurations
- Management of hostnames for peers
- Full user management (creating, editing, deleting accounts)
- Full peer management (creating, editing, deleting configurations)

### Success Criteria

1. **Distribution Automation**
   - Users can independently download their assigned WireGuard configurations without contacting an administrator
   - Reduce configuration issuance time from >15 minutes (manual) to <2 minutes (self-service)

2. **Complete Records**
   - System registers all peer assignments to users
   - Administrator has insight into history: who, when, and which configuration was downloaded
   - No "loss" of information about issued configurations

3. **Access Control**
   - Users can download only configurations assigned to them
   - Administrator can manage limits and assignments through web interface
   - System enforces login before accessing configurations

4. **Stability and Usability**
   - Application correctly reads all configurations from directory
   - Interface is intuitive (user can download configuration without instructions)
   - No critical errors preventing basic functions

Analyze the information provided, focusing on aspects relevant to PRD creation. Consider the following questions:
<prd_analysis>
1. Identify the main problem that the product is intended to solve.
2. Define the key functionalities of the MVP.
3. Consider potential user stories and paths of product usage.
4. Think about success criteria and how to measure them.
5. Assess design constraints and their impact on product development.
</prd_analysis>

Based on your analysis, generate a list of 10 questions and recommendations in a combined form (question + recommendation). These should address any ambiguities, potential issues, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective PRD. Consider questions about:

1. Details of the user's problem
2. Prioritization of functionality
3. Expected user experience
4. Measurable success indicators
5. Potential risks and challenges
6. Schedule and resources

<questions>
List your questions and recommendations here, numbered for clarity:

For example:
1. Are you planning to introduce paid subscriptions from the start of the project?

Recommendation: The first phase of the project could focus on free features to attract users, and paid features could be introduced at a later stage.
</questions>

Continue this process, generating new questions and recommendations based on the user's responses, until the user explicitly asks for a summary.

Remember to focus on clarity, relevance, and accuracy of results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

Analytical work should be done in the thinking block. The final output should consist solely of questions and recommendations and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the prd_analysis section.
